The perpuse of this project is to complete Udacity course: [front-end web development](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011).

### What I learned
I learned from this app how create server side get and post methods and client side get and post methods, using fetch method and create async/await functions also combine api results with html tags, . 

### Resoarces
Faced some error in fetching and found [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54374597/javascript-access-to-fetch-at-https-from-origin-http-has-been-blocked) healpfull in solving it. 

Found [this page](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-and-post-method-using-fetch-api/?ref=rp) and [this page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-api-calls-with-fetch/) helpful in explaining and writting the code.
